# Javi
An easy programming language for beginners to start learning.

# Documentation

This is the start where you can view documentation from version 1.0.0 - [Latest_ver] 
javi jre-1.0.0

to get yourself started there are requierments you need (these get updated from time to time)
to get started, you should do/download the requierments below:

1. Python 3.9
2. Sly for python 3.9

------ installation -----
Python
Installing python is fairly easy, it is also documented on their site.
you can download it at https://python.org/
(note that 3.9 is needed, 3.10 probbably wont work untill officialy
supported by the javi language.)
make sure to check "Add python 3.9 to path" or else anything
else wont work.
to verify installation in windows type:
python --version

in linux (or Ubuntu) you type this in terminal to get it installed:
sudo apt update

sudo apt install software-properties-common

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

sudo apt install python3.9

and to verify in linux or Ubuntu type (in terminal) :
python3.9 --version


Sly for python
Installing sly is also easy and is fully auotmated procces.
to download sly its more easy than download python.
sly works with any release of javi unless documented that it doesnt.
to install sly you must run this simple command.
For windows you type this (in command prompt) :
pip install sly

For linux (or known as Ubuntu) you type (in terminal):

sudo pip install sly

sudo pip install PyInstaller


That's it!
all you do next is extract the javi_jre-1.0.0.tar.gz on anywhere you like and your started!

Note:
to extract on ubuntu or linux type:
tar -xvf javi_jre-1.0.0.tar.gz

How to run
-----------------
Windows

Step 1: open a command prompt window here. or a powershell. both will probbably work but we are using command prompt for this.
Step 2: type 
python javi.py
 and press enter
Step 3: type on command prompt in the javi location 
javiw -v
 or 
javiw --version
 and if it worked it should say "javi version jre-1.0.0"
Step 4: If all steps Worked you can use it!

Linux (Ubuntu)

Step 1: open a terminal here in the javi location.
Step 2: type 
python3 javi.py
 And if that doesn't work consider using this command: 
sudo python3 javi.py

Step 3: in Ubuntu or Linux you can't verify installation so you will just have to see if it works.
Step 4: If all steps Worked on Linux or Ubuntu then you got it and you can use it!

It should end up with it installed and all steps should work as said!

Printing and the basics
These are the most basics that you need to know!

to print its very easy! Like very easy!
in order to print you must type
print="Hello, World!"

to set the print variable and to print it do:
print

and it will automaticlly print it
you can also change the print variable because it goes from top to bottom
to change it simply do:
print="Print is Changed!"

and to verify its changed do
print


And this is the end of Printing And The Basics! 
here's a preview(s) of what we did on Printing and the basics
Image
so basiclly the the output was this:
Javi jre-1.0.0
Run >> print="Hello, World!"
Run >> print
"Hello, World!"
Run >>
Run >> print="Print is Changed!"
"Print is Changed!"
Run >>
Run >>
End
End
End

Numbers, Math and variables
how to print numbers and how to make variables

Making variables and printing numbers is easy. after all this language is made to be easy for new coders
Numbers
to store numbers you can type c=1
and you can also make another one called x=2
(those are variables and you can store numbers in them!)
you can type this to store the number 1 on a variable named c
c=1

you can type this to store the number 2 on a variable named x
x=2

and you can print them by doing this:
c

output:
1

x

output:
2


Math. we can use math operators to display them in calculation:
the operators are + - /
you can calculate using these
for e.g. 1+1 2+2 1-1 2-2 1/1 2/1
etc etc

we can also use them on variables including numbers
for e.g. c is set to 2 and x to 1
we can do
c + x

and it will output:
3


you can also do the others at the top i meantioned

Exyrus explains the rest, thank you for reading.

String Variables

Variables can be declared via 
yourvariablename="string"
 
Inside the quotation marks, write the text that will be represented by the text before the equals sign.
For example:
dog="boston_terrier"

All of the things we've shown here should look ike this:
